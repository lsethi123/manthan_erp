              %h2 Logo:
              %p The logo of Manthan International School depicts a couple of birds flying around the glowing sun. The suggestion, without any doubt, is birds learn to fly, soar high and utilize the light of the sun to acquire a distinctive panoramic view of things, a unique perspective. Manthan desires that all its students learn how to learn and use their abilities to learn creatively to bring in “a light that never was on land and sea” and thereby add special worth to things.

              %h2 Manthan Means:
              %p The term ‘manthan’ (derived from manthanam in Sanskrit) means ‘to churn.’ The process of churning is associated most readily with production of butter. Butter is essentially the smooth substance obtained by churning cream. Milk which is rich in various nutrients and has a myriad health benefits associated with it has been accepted in all cultures since time immemorial as one of the most important foods that sustain life. Cream is the fat that milk contains. Butter can therefore be considered to be the cream of the cream or crème de la crème which means the very best or something superlative.
